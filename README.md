# bradley-headertool
Discontinued header analysis tool I made to use at work

How to use:
Open headertool.ps1 and paste an email header into the box.
Alternatively, you can open the HTML port of the tool.

There's a lot of false flag and this is a few versions behind from what I was actually using in production - but if you're working in managed IT, and have to deal with a lot of spam emails, this might help you a bit.
